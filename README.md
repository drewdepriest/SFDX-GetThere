## "How do you add 'Get There' to a Lightning Record Page so that users can have access to the map?
I built this prototype to help answer a question posed by a user on the Trailblazer Community boards looking to implement a map to an Account record page that would let you call a rideshare to take you to that account's location. (https://trailblazers.salesforce.com/answers?id=9063A000000puWaQAI)

Having worked with the Uber Deeplink Generator (https://eng.uber.com/uber-deeplink/) in the past, this seemed a good opportunity to stitch it together with a simple lightning-map interface.
